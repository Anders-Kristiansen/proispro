## Color Spaces — What to Use When

| Task                            | Use                                    | Why                                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Perceptual color manipulation   | **OKLCH**                              | Best uniformity for lightness, chroma, hue. Fixes CIELAB's blue problem.  |
| CSS gradients & palettes        | **OKLCH** or `color-mix(in oklab)`     | No mid-gradient darkening like RGB/HSL                                    |
| Gamut-aware color picking       | **OKHSL / OKHSV**                      | Ottosson's picker spaces — cylindrical like HSL but perceptually grounded |
| Normalized saturation (0-100%)  | **HSLuv**                              | CIELUV chroma normalized per hue/lightness. HPLuv for pastels.            |
| Print workflows                 | **CIELAB D50**                         | ICC standard illuminant                                                   |
| Screen workflows                | **CIELAB D65** or OKLAB                | D65 = screen standard                                                     |
| Cross-media appearance matching | **CAM16 / CIECAM02**                   | Accounts for surround, adaptation, luminance, and viewing conditions      |
| HDR                             | **Jzazbz / ICtCp**                     | Designed for extended dynamic range                                       |
| Pigment/paint mixing simulation | **Kubelka-Munk** (Spectral.js, Mixbox) | Spectral reflectance mixing, not RGB averaging                            |
| Color difference (precision)    | **CIEDE2000**                          | Gold standard perceptual distance                                         |
| Color difference (fast)         | **Euclidean in OKLAB**                 | Good enough for most applications                                         |
| Video/image compression         | **YCbCr**                              | Luma+chroma separation enables chroma subsampling                         |

### Understanding HSL's Limitations

HSL isn't "bad" — it's a simple, fast geometric rearrangement of RGB into a cylinder. It's fine for quick color picking and basic UI work. But its three channels don't correspond to human perception:

- **Lightness (L):** fully saturated yellow (`hsl(60,100%,50%)`) and fully saturated blue (`hsl(240,100%,50%)`) have the same L=50% but vastly different perceived brightness. L is a mathematical average, not a perceptual measurement.
- **Hue (H):** non-uniform spacing. A 20° shift near red produces a dramatic change; the same 20° near green is barely visible. The green region is compressed, reds are stretched.
- **Saturation (S):** doesn't correlate with perceived saturation. A color can have S=100% and still look muted (e.g., dark saturated blue).

**When HSL is fine:** simple color pickers, quick CSS tweaks, situations where perceptual accuracy doesn't matter.

**When to use something better:**

- Generating palettes or scales → **OKLCH** (uniform lightness across hues)
- Creating gradients → **OKLAB** or `color-mix(in oklab)` (no mid-gradient darkening)
- Gamut-aware picking with HSL-like UX → **OKHSL** (Ottosson's perceptual HSL)
- Normalized saturation 0–100% → **HSLuv** (CIELUV-based, no out-of-bounds)

### Named Hue (HSL/HSV) Ranges

| Name       | Degrees       |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| **red**    | 345–360, 0–15 |
| **orange** | 15–45         |
| **yellow** | 45–70         |
| **green**  | 70–165        |
| **cyan**   | 165–195       |
| **blue**   | 195–260       |
| **purple** | 260–310       |
| **pink**   | 310–345       |
| **warm**   | 0–70          |
| **cool**   | 165–310       |

### Key Distinctions

- **Chroma** = colorfulness relative to a same-lightness neutral reference
- **Saturation** = perceived colorfulness relative to the color's own brightness
- **Lightness** = perceived reflectance relative to a similarly lit white
- **Brightness** = perceived intensity of light coming from a stimulus
- Same chroma ≠ same saturation. These are different dimensions.

## Implementation Guidance — Code and CSS

When using colors in a program or CSS, add a semantic layer between raw color values and UI roles.

- **Use reference tokens for concrete colors**: `ref.red = #f00`
- **Use semantic tokens for meaning/role**: `semantic.warning = ref.red`
- **Prefer semantic tokens in components** so themes can swap meaning without rewriting component code.
- **This default applies in any language**; translate to the target system's equivalent alias/reference mechanism (CSS custom properties, Swift enums, design-token JSON, etc.).
- **Encode color decisions when possible** instead of freezing one manual choice into a literal.

Pseudocode examples:

- `ref.red := closest('red', generatedPalette)`
- `semantic.warning := ref.red`
- `semantic.onSurface := mostReadableOn(surface)`

Good pattern: palette/reference tokens define available colors; semantic tokens map those colors to roles like surface, text, accent, success, warning, and danger.

## Accessibility — Key Numbers

Of ~281 trillion hex color pairs:

| Threshold                 | % passing | Odds            |
| ------------------------- | --------- | --------------- |
| WCAG 3:1 (large text)     | 26.49%    | ~1 in 4         |
| WCAG 4.5:1 (AA body text) | 11.98%    | ~1 in 8         |
| WCAG 7:1 (AAA)            | 3.64%     | ~1 in 27        |
| APCA 60                   | 7.33%     | ~1 in 14        |
| APCA 75 (fluent reading)  | 1.57%     | ~1 in 64        |
| APCA 90 (preferred body)  | **0.08%** | **~1 in 1,250** |

APCA is far more restrictive than WCAG at comparable readability.

## Color Harmony — What Actually Works

### Hue-first harmony is a weak standalone heuristic

Complementary, triadic, tetradic intervals are weak predictors of mood, legibility, or accessibility on their own. Every hue plane has a different shape in perceptual space, so geometric hue intervals do not guarantee perceptual balance.

### Character-first harmony works (Ellen Divers' research)

Organize by character (pale/muted/deep/vivid/dark), not hue. **Hue is usually a weaker predictor of emotional response than chroma and lightness** — a muted palette often reads as calm across many hues.

### Legibility = lightness variation

Grayscale is a quick sanity check for lightness separation, not an accessibility proof. You still need to verify contrast with WCAG/APCA and consider text size, weight, polarity, and CVD.

### The 60-30-10 rule

60% dominant color, 30% secondary, 10% accent. One color dominates to prevent "three equally-sized gorillas fighting."

## Pigment Mixing — Not What You Think

- **Pigment mixing is not well described by the simple subtractive model alone** — "integrated mixing" (Küppers/Briggs) is a better practical description.
- **CMY mixing paths curve outward** (retain chroma = vivid secondaries) — "extroverted octopus"
- **RGB mixing paths curve inward** (lose chroma = dull browns) — "introverted octopus"
- **Mixing is non-linear**: proportion of paint ≠ proportional hue change.
- **Blue→yellow is a LONG road**, red→yellow is SHORT. Traditional wheel massively misrepresents distances.
- **For spectral/K-M mixing in code**: use Spectral.js (open source) or Mixbox (commercial).

## Color Temperature

- **Temperature ≠ hue** — it's a systematic shift of BOTH hue AND saturation, dependent on starting hue
- **Cool daylight**: blue atmospheric scatter fills shadows
- **Warm incandescent**: favors long wavelengths including infrared
- **Green and purple** do not map cleanly to warm/cool

## Color Naming — Multiple Systems

| System                | Register                   | Example                            |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| ISCC-NBS              | Scientific precision       | "vivid yellowish green"            |
| Munsell               | Systematic notation        | "5GY 7/10"                         |
| XKCD                  | Common perception          | "ugly yellow", "hospital green"    |
| Traditional Japanese  | Cultural/poetic            | "wasurenagusa-iro" (forget-me-not) |
| RAL                   | Industrial reproducibility | RAL 5002                           |
| CSS Named Colors      | Web standard               | 147 named colors                   |
