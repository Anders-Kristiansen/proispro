## Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| **Frontend** | Alpine.js (CDN) + vanilla CSS with OKLCH color system |
| **Backend** | Supabase PostgreSQL with Row-Level Security (RLS) |
| **Auth** | Supabase Auth – GitHub OAuth provider |
| **Hosting** | GitHub Pages (static, no build step) |

## Getting Started

### 1. Local Development (No Cloud)

Simply open `index.html` in your browser. The app works in **localStorage mode** — all data is stored locally in your browser.

### 2. With Supabase Backend (Cloud Sync)

See `[docs/supabase-setup.md](docs/supabase-setup.md)` for full setup instructions.

## Architecture Overview

**Frontend:** `index.html` loads Alpine.js and Supabase client via CDN. No build step. ~250 lines of reactive JavaScript.

**Backend:** Supabase PostgreSQL database with Row-Level Security policies ensuring users can only access their own discs.

**Auth:** GitHub OAuth via Supabase Auth. Users log in with GitHub → receive JWT → all database queries validated by RLS.

**Offline fallback:** If Supabase is unavailable, app silently falls back to localStorage. User can still view/edit discs locally; changes sync when cloud is available.
